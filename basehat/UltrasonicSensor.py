Ultrasonic Sensor:
    Description:
        This sensor can be used to determine the distance between the sensor and a surface in 
        front of it. This is done by emitting high frequecy sound and then detecting the reflected 
        sound, using the delay between transmission and reception to calculate the distance. This
        sensor outputs a distance in centimeters, with an accurate range between 3 cm and 350 cm.

    Hardware:
        Connect this sensor to any digital port on the Grove BaseHAT (any port starting with D)
        Initialize the sensor using only the number of the port, DO NOT include the A.

    Initialization:
        sensor_name = UltrasonicSensor(pin)

        If you plug your Ultrasonic Sensor into A0 and want to name it 'ultra', your initialization 
        will look like this:

        ultra = UltrasonicSensor(0)

    UltrasonicSensor.getDist:
        Read the value from the sensor, outputting the measured distance in cm. If your sensor's 
        name is 'ultra', accessing this value will look like this:

        dist = ultra.getDist

    UltrasonicSensor_Example.py: 
        Usage of this code is demonstrated in the example file for this sensor in the Examples
        folder on your Pi's desktop.
