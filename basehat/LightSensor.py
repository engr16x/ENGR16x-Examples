Light Sensor:
    Description:
        This sensor converts the light level at the bulb shaped detector into a voltage 
        which can then be read as an integer representing the total brightness.

    Hardware:
        Connect this sensor to any analog port on the Grove BaseHAT: A0, A2, A4, or A6.
        Initialize the sensor using only the number of the port, DO NOT include the A.

    Initialization:
        sensor_name = LightSensor(pin)

        If you plug your light sensor into A0 and want to name it 'light', your initialization 
        will look like this:

        light = LightSensor(0)

    LightSensor.light:
        Read the value from the light sensor, ranging from 0 to ~615. If your sensor name is 
        'light', accessing the light value will look like this:

        value_from_sensor = light.light
    
    LightSensor_Example.py: 
        Usage of this code is demonstrated in the example file for this sensor in the Examples
        folder on your Pi's desktop.
